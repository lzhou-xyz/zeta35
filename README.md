Codes for the paper  "AT LEAST TWO OF ζ(5), ζ(7), . . . , ζ(35) ARE IRRATIONAL".

The paper could be downloaded from arxiv:  XXXX/xxx.



main_zeta35.m is the code for the proof of main **Theorem 1.2** : At least two of ζ(5), ζ(7), ... , ζ(35) are irrational.

 For the purpose of consistency, the names of  variables are the same as those in the paper. It takes almost 1 minute to get the results as follows :



 (c1-c2)/m2=0.002669335189699

 c1 = 1.677993128952727e+04

 c2 = 1.677928264107618e+04



main_beta10.m is the code for the proof of  **Theorem 6.1**:  At least one of β(2), β(4), β(6), β(8), β(10) is irrational. 

It takes a few seconds to get the results as follows:  



![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\widetilde{\Phi}_{n}^{-1}d_{\widetilde{M}}^{11}\right)^{1/n}) = exp(-9.052339772597534e+02)


![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\widetilde{r}_{n}^{1/n}) = exp(9.034669134561257e+02).
